# AI-Powered Retail Assistant for T-Shirt Sales

Welcome to the AI-Powered Retail Assistant for T-Shirt Sales! This project features a cutting-edge LLM-based system utilizing Google Palm and Langchain to interact with a MySQL database through natural language queries. The system is designed to help users effortlessly retrieve information from the database by asking questions in plain language, which are then converted into SQL queries and executed.

In this project, we simulate a T-shirt store managing its inventory, sales, and discounts in a MySQL database. Store managers can ask questions like:
- "How many white Adidas T-shirts are left in stock?"
- "What would be the projected sales if we sell all extra-small size T-shirts after applying discounts?"

Our intelligent system translates these questions into accurate SQL queries and fetches the necessary data from the database.
